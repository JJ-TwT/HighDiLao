# HighDiLao
Built for the Xylem Global Student Innovation Challenge 2025

HighDiLao is a synthetic weather data generator and flood detection system. It is a full-stack climate data simulation pipeline that:
* Generates synthetic daily precipitation data using Markov Chains and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based on historical data provided
* Trains an XGBoost classifier on historical rainfall patterns to detect heavy storms and flag flash flood warnings
* Visualizes predicted storm periods and dangerous rainfall spikes over a synthetic timeline

Our goal is to simulate realistic rainfall data and predict flood-prone periods, allowing communities and governments to better prepare for extreme weather events, especially in urban areas like Singapore, hence building flood resilience in our community. HighDiLao would also help to increase the accuracy of current forecasting models by providing accurate synthetic data to train these models.
